# Introduction

* Welcome to the New Relic Rust Workshop.
* This is part 1 of 4 sessions.
* Each day will be divided into four hours, with a 10-12 minute break at the end of each hour.
* Please let me know in the chat what languages you're used to working with, and your experience level with Rust.
* If I go too fast, please say something.
* If you have questions, please either drop them in the chat or let me know.
* We'll create a Git repo on Github for the class, and commit to it as we go. That way, you have everything we create together. You also have this outline.
* The video for this class should be available in about a week, you should have received an email telling you how to access it.
* Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions you have at any time.
* It's easier to interact if you leave your cameras on, but it's ok if you can't or don't want to.
